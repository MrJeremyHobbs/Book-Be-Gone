## Overview
Book-Be-Gone is for withdrawing books in Alma. A user scans the barcode of an item and Book-Be-Gone performs some checks before adding it to a set in Alma. The user then run the "withdraw items" job on the set to finish the process.
Book-Be-Gone can also append the OCLC numbers for all scanned items into a plain text file. This file can then be loaded into OCLC Connexion for the purpose of withdrawing holdings.
